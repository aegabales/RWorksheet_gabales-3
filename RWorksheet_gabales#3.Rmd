# Using Vectors

**1.There is a built-in vector LETTERS contains the uppercase letters of the alphabet and letters which contains the lowercase letters of the alphabet**\
```{}
> LETTERS <- c("A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G", "H", "I", "J", 
               "K", "L", "M", "N", "O", "P", "Q", "R", "S", "T",
               "U", "V", "W", "X", "Y", "Z")
> LETTERS	
 [1] "A" "B" "C" "D" "E" "F" "G" "H" "I" "J" "K" "L" "M" "N" "O"
[16] "P" "Q" "R" "S" "T" "U" "V" "W" "X" "Y" "Z"

> letters <- c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f", "g", "h", "i", "j",
+              "k", "l", "m", "n", "o", "p", "q", "r", "s", "t",
+              "u", "v", "w", "x", "y", "z")
> letters
 [1] "a" "b" "c" "d" "e" "f" "g" "h" "i" "j" "k" "l" "m" "n" "o"
[16] "p" "q" "r" "s" "t" "u" "v" "w" "x" "y" "z"
 
```

### Based on the above vector LETTERS:\
***a.	You need to produce a vector that contains the first 11 letters.***
```{}
> LETTERS[-(12:26)]
 [1] "A" "B" "C" "D" "E" "F" "G" "H" "I" "J" "K"
```

***b.	Produce a vector that contains the odd numbered letters.***
```{}
> LETTERS[1:26 %% 2 != 0]
 [1] "A" "C" "E" "G" "I" "K" "M" "O" "Q" "S" "U" "W" "Y"
```

***c.	Produce a vector that contains the vowels.***
```{}
> vowels <- LETTERS[c(1,5,9,15,21)]
> vowels
[1] "A" "E" "I" "O" "U"
```
### Based on the above vector letters:\
***d.	Produce a vector that contains the last 5 lowercase letters.***
```{}
   > letters[-(1:21)]
      [1] "v" "w" "x" "y" "z"
```
***e.	Produce a vector that contains letters between 15 to 24 letters in lowercase.***
```{}
	> letters[15:24]
	 [1] "o" "p" "q" "r" "s" "t" "u" "v" "w" "x"
```

[4] "Tacloban"        "Samal Island"    "Davao City"
```

***b.	The average temperatures in Celcius are 42, 39, 34, 34, 30, and 27 degrees. Name the object as temp. Write the R code and its output. Numbers should also follow what is in the instruction.***

		The array has 3 dimensions.

***c.	Name the rows as lowercase letters and columns as uppercase letters starting from the A. The array names should be “1st-Dimensional Array”, “2nd-Dimentional Array”, and “3rd-Dimensional Array”. What will be the R codes and its output?***
